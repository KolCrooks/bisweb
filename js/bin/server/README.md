This is the BioImage Suite Web Fileserver. This is a small helper app that
allows the web-based applications to access the local filesystem.

To use (with care)

1. Install Node.js vs 8.x (LTS)
2. cd to this directory
3. run `npm update` -- this will install the dependencies of this script
4. node bisfileserver.js will run the server

For help and options type

    node bisfileserver.js -h
    
See `example-server-config.json` in this directory, for an example
configuration file.
