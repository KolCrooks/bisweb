## Welcome to BioImage Suite Web

BioImage Suite Web (BisWeb) is a web-based medical image analysis suite primarily
geared towards Neuroimaging Analysis. We gratefully acknowledge support from
the [NIH Brain Initiative](https://www.braininitiative.nih.gov/) under grant R24 MH114805 (Papademetris X. and Scheinost D. PIs).
A good overview of the software can be found
[in slides from a presentation at the 2018 NIH Brain Initiative Meeting](web/images/BioImageSuiteWeb_NIHBrainInitiativeMeeting_April2018.pdf),
which was the first public introduction of the software.

BisWeb is a hybrid application and toolkit. It contains a set of command line
tools, and desktop and web applications. In addition the code is
modular/componentized and may be useful as a basis for other applications as well.

The software is currently in late beta version. A fully working `demo` version
can be found at [bisweb.yale.edu/demo](bisweb.yale.edu/demo).

For developer documentation please look in the [doc](doc) directory of this
repository, starting with [doc/README.md](doc/README.md).
