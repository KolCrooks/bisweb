Before you do anything else you must install Node.js version 8 (ideally 8.9.x
or newer). We have not tested with Node.js v9 or v10. You may obtain this from https://nodejs.org/en/

To run the scripts

1. Optionally set your paths

On Mac/Linux type

   source setpaths.sh

(Or source setpaths.csh if you are running csh/tcsh)

On MS-Windows type

   setpaths.bat

2. Then execute the tool of your choice. (The scripts are in the bin, or
winbin if on MS-WINDOWS, directory.) As an example to run the smooth image
script (and get its help page) type:

   bw_smoothImage -h
